Project:P5 trees
Author: David Bennett
Course: cs 2420
Date: 4/5/2021

Description: A paragraph from around the world in 80 days is taken
and the letters are organized into a tree as a key value pair, where
the key is the letter and the value is the number of times the letter
shows up in the tree

Lessons Learned:
-The remove function is very confusing.
-Learned new things from each function and how to set up a tree
-Learned how to better intergrate code
